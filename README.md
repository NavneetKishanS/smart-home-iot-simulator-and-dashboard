# IoT Smart Home Simulator

IoT Smart Home Simulator is a Python-based application developed by Navneet Kishan Srinivasan that simulates a smart home environment. This application allows users to control smart devices such as lights, security cameras, and thermostats through a graphical user interface (GUI), leveraging the power of the Tkinter library.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**: The simulator is written in Python 3, ensuring wide compatibility and ease of use.
- **Tkinter**: Utilizes Tkinter for the GUI, providing a user-friendly interface to interact with the smart devices.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The project is structured using OOP principles, making it modular and scalable.

## Features
- Control simulated smart devices including lights, security cameras, and thermostats.
- Adjust device settings such as light brightness and thermostat temperature through the GUI.
- Add new devices dynamically to the simulation through the "Add Device" feature.

## Usage
To get started with the IoT Smart Home Simulator, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install any required libraries or dependencies.
4. **Run the Simulator**: Execute the `SmartDeviceGUI.py` script to start the simulator.
5. **Interact with Devices**: Use the GUI to interact with the simulated smart devices.

## Note
This project is designed as an educational tool to understand the basics of smart home technologies and GUI programming in Python. It's a starting point for more complex projects and learning opportunities.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- Tkinter library
